# CAD_branch_predictor
The repositary contains different types of branch predictors 
They all can be executed with the google colab link. The only requirement of executing the code is uploading the Trace_01.txt file in the colab file. Make sure the uploaded file and the file name in the code are the same.
The trace file is uploaded in the repositary as well.
